# Novel Approach to Deep Brain Stimulation for Successful Memory Encoding
The data is from here: https://memory.psych.upenn.edu/Data

Please note that my analysis only uses 38 subject data when there is a total of 102 subjects! If you would like a quick summary of how the data was collected, please read this research paper: https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822(17)30326-3.pdf

The main aim of my analysis was to create an extented and better version of current DBS research for memory.

This autonomated process can understand the brain's encoding states much better, and utilize these results to create predictions on when to apply DBS for highest memory performance.
